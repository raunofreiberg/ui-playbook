Popover is an interactive contextual overlay that provides additional content or actions.

## Functionality

- Opens via keyboard or when the trigger element is clicked by the mouse.
- Dismissed with the `Escape` key or by navigating outside.
- Traps focus inside the popover, and restores it when dismissed.
- Has pre-defined positioning options, but should adjust itself dynamically based on collisions and available space.

## Best practices

### Avoid for primary actions or content

A popover should not be used simply due to poor design or lack of space in layout. The content inside a popover should not be critical to the user's primary task on the page.

Aim to use a popover for secondary actions or supplementary information, such as filters or keyboard shortcuts.

### Indicate additional content

The appearance of a popover should not come as a surprise to the user. Strive to hint that there's additional content to be displayed from the trigger element.

A clear and predictable label, such as "Actions" or "Select item", along with an icon, can help convey the expectation of additional content.

### Position aside the trigger element

A popover should be non-disruptive and appear contextually in relation to the element that it opens from.

Avoid using a popover for a full screen overlay. Instead, consider using a Modal.

## Implementation

### Positioning

To avoid parent containers possibly clipping the popover and its content, render the popover outside the DOM hierarchy of its parent component.

For React, a common mechanism for this is a [Portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html).

### Trigger element

In most cases, a `<button>` element is used for the trigger by the consumer. However, in the case of a string or a non-interactive element, make sure to fall back to

## Accessibility

### Keyboard interaction and focus

- Opens via the `Enter` or `Space` keys or by clicking the trigger element.
- Focus moves into the popover container to navigate elements inside with the `Tab` key.
- Dismissed by tabbing out of the popover, pressing the `Escape` key, or clicking outside.
- When dismissed, focus returns to the trigger element.

### ARIA attributes

- The trigger element has [`aria-expanded`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-expanded) set to `true` or `false` based on the open state.
- The trigger element has [`aria-controls`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-controls) set to the `id` of the popover element.
- The trigger element has [`aria-haspopup`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-haspopup) set to the suitable `role` attribute of the popover, depending on the type of content.

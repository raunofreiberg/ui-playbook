Motion brings meaning and a sense of life to the experience.
<!--It should be purposeful, intuitive, and seamless. It should help users be more productive and never slow them down. -->

## Principles

The principles of motion can vary, depending on the brand and style of an interface.
However, there are a few generally applicable fundamentals to take into consideration.

## Be predictable

Imagine throwing a ball into a hoop, and instead of it falling through — it just disappears!

As humans, we make sense of the world through interactions and observations around us.
In real life, objects enter and leave our perception in a symmetrical and fluid movement.

Therefore, aim to maintain a consistent [spatial understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_ability#Spatial_perception) throughout the experience, similar to the real world.

<!-- example (fade elements in and out) -->

## Be purposeful

Strive to apply motion with an informative purpose by highlighting connections between items,
providing a focal point, or responding to an interaction with feedback.

Not only does this make the interface feel responsive and alive,
but with the combination of predictable and purposeful motion, we can start to make sense of an interface and develop an intuition for future interactions.

## Be playful

We've all experienced this one interaction that you can't stop playing with because it just _feels_ right.

Motion can introduce a certain level of character and playfulness to seemingly common interactions and [delight the user in an unexpected way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2d9rw9RwyE).

For example, applying motion to an empty state, loading indicator, or a success screen is a great way to delight your users and celebrate their journey.

## Implementation

We can separate motion into three tiers:

### Tier A

The first tier of motion are CSS transitions triggered by a user interaction via hover, touch, or click. These are mostly trivial to implement.

<CheckboxExample />

Foo.

### Tier B

The second tier of motion includes CSS animations and slightly more complicated entrance and exit animations.

<Notifications />

### Tier C

SVG?

## Accessibility

However playful and enjoyable an interaction may be, be mindful of the fact that not everybody can feel the same way.

Some people may not consider motion to be an important part of their experience, or in extreme cases it can even trigger physical reactions such as nausea and dizziness.

In most operating systems, users may opt out of motion from their accessibility settings. As a result, all of the native animations are disabled.

When implementing animations on the web, it is crucial to respect the choice of the user. We can use the [`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) media query to do so:

```css
.button {
    width: 100px;
    height: 40px;
    transform: scale(1);
}

.button:hover {
    transform: scale(1.2);
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .button {
    transition: transform 300ms;
  }
}
```

Instead of removing animations in the media query, we will default to no animations and add them for users who haven't explicitly opted out.
This also means that if the browser does not support the query, it will just ignore it and not provide animations.

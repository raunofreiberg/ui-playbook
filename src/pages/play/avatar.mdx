Avatar is a visual representation of an individual or business in the interface.

<div className="center">
    <Avatar
        name="Rauno Freiberg"
        src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/23662329?s=460&u=36a57df2205eb37b9e2f221a12df10d5f4387786&v=4"

## Best practices

### Provide a image

Whenever possible, try to use a thumbnail image of the user instead of a boring, default human silhouette placeholder.

Not only does this give an additional humanizing touch to the interface,
but it can help to visually organize, remember, and make sense of sections with multiple users.

### Generate a unique image fallback

If the image does not load or is unavailable — consider alternatives that are unique to the user.

For example, you could display initials with an unique background image that is based on the username:

<Avatar name="Rauno Freiberg" style={{ marginRight: 8 }} />
<Avatar name="Joe Doe" style={{ marginRight: 8 }} />
<Avatar name="Michael Jordan" style={{ marginBottom: 24 }} />

This way the identity of the user will always be unique and pure!

### Expose multiple sizes

A single size avatar does not work for every use case.
Due to inherent constraints, tables usually require a smaller variant, whereas profile cards can accommodate a larger one.

At the very least, consider exposing two sizes for an avatar — small and large.

## Implementation

### Use the `<img>` element

To ensure that the image of the avatar is accessible to users with screen readers, use the `<img>` element along with the `alt` attribute.

> Additionally, you may want to use [`object-fit: cover`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) on the `<img>` element to accommodate larger images.

### Generating unique fallbacks

There are lots of ways you could generate unique fallback images.

I've used an awesome microservice called [Avatar](https://github.com/tobiaslins/avatar) which you can use as an API and receive an image: https://avatar.tobi.sh/raunofreiberg

If this does not work for your use case, there are open source implementations of a similar algorithm:

- [hash-avatar](https://github.com/bukinoshita/hash-avatar)
- [random-gradient](https://github.com/bukinoshita/random-gradient)

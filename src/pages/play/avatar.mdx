Avatar is an visual representation of a user in the interface.

<div className="center">
    <Avatar
      name="Rauno Freiberg"
      src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/23662329?s=460&u=36a57df2205eb37b9e2f221a12df10d5f4387786&v=4"

## Best practices

### Provide an image

Whenever possible, try to use a thumbnail image of a user instead of a dull, default human silhouette placeholder.

Not only does this give an additional humanizing touch to the interface,
but it can help to visually organize, remember, and make sense of sections with multiple users.

### Generate a unique image fallback

If the image does not load or is unavailable — consider alternatives that are unique to a user.

For example, you could display initials with a unique background image that is based on the user's name:

<Avatar name="Rauno Freiberg" style={{ marginRight: 8 }} />
<Avatar name="Joe Doe" style={{ marginRight: 8 }} />
<Avatar name="Michael Jordan" style={{ marginBottom: 24 }} />

This way the identity of the user will always be unique and pure!

### Expose multiple sizes

A single size avatar does not work for every use case.
For example, due to inherent layout constraints, tables, usually require a smaller variant, whereas profile cards can accommodate a larger one.

At the very least, consider exposing two sizes — large and small.

<Avatar
  name="Rauno Freiberg"
  src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/23662329?s=460&u=36a57df2205eb37b9e2f221a12df10d5f4387786&v=4"
  size="large"
  style={{ marginRight: 8 }}
/>
<Avatar

/>

## Implementation

### Use the [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element

To ensure that the image of the avatar is accessible to users with screen readers, use the `<img>` element along with the `alt` attribute set to the user's name.

Additionally, you may want to use the CSS property [`object-fit: cover`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) on the `<img>` element to accommodate larger images.

### Generating unique fallbacks

There are lots of ways to generate unique fallback images.

> For users to have unique identities, use the full name instead of initials to generate the image.

The examples above use an awesome micro-service called [avatar](https://github.com/tobiaslins/avatar) which you can use as an API to receive an image: https://avatar.tobi.sh/raunofreiberg.

If you'd like to generate a similar image without the service, there are open source implementations of a similar algorithm:

- [hash-avatar](https://github.com/bukinoshita/hash-avatar)
- [random-gradient](https://github.com/bukinoshita/random-gradient)

## Accessibility

By using the `<img>` element for the image, a lot of the accessibility requirements for this component are met.

However, if you want to use a placeholder like an `<svg>` or `background-color` for the fallback, make sure to add the following attributes:

- Set [`role="img"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Role_Img) on the placeholder element
- Set [`aria-label`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute) to the user's name on the placeholder element

```html
<svg role="img" aria-label="Rauno Freiberg">
  <!-- Contents of SVG -->
</svg>
```

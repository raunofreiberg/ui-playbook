Checkbox is an input control that lets users select one or more options from a list of options.

<div className="center">
  <Checkbox defaultChecked>Checkbox label</Checkbox>
</div>

## Functionality

This component should use the [HTML `<input type="checkbox" />` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) under the hood.

### Hover state

Indicates that the checkbox is interactive when hovered with the mouse.

### Active state

Indicates that the checkbox is currently being activated.

### Focus state

Indicates that the focus in the document is currently on the checkbox.

> For the sake of aesthetics, it can be tempting to remove default browser focus styles with `outline: 0;` <br /><br />
> Do not do this before adding your own custom focus styles!

### Disabled state

Indicates that the checkbox is not interactive.

If necessary, used in combination with a <Link href="/play/tooltip">Tooltip</Link> to provide a brief explanation on hover.

### Checked state

Indicates whether the checkbox has been selected.

### Indeterminate state

Indicates that the checkbox is partially selected.

This can be useful for nested checkboxes where not all of the sub-checkboxes are selected.

<Checkboxes />

## Best practices

### Provide a label

A standalone checkbox without a label does not indicate its function. Make sure to associate the checkbox with a visible label.

Not only does this provide context and a larger hit area for toggling the checkbox, but screen readers will announce the label when the checkbox is focused.

### Do not trigger actions

Checkboxes should not be used to trigger immediate actions like enabling or disabling a feature.
Instead, request confirmation from the user before making changes.

A more suitable alternative for toggling options would be the Toggle component.

## Accessibility

By using the native checkbox element, you get a lot of the accessibility features out of the box.
